#+TITLE: Org Parser

A work-in-progress parser for Org files. This project is intended to parse and play with a subset of Org syntax that I use regularly.

As you can see on [[https://github.com/veera-sivarajan/org-parser/blob/fc512c437f972dd7545cb7ba121ccbd9891d6bee/src/parser.rs#L61][parser.rs]], the parser supports the following Org elements.
1. Title
2. Date
3. Unordered lists
4. Ordered lists
5. Codeblocks
6. Level 1 headings
7. Level 2 headings
8. Level 3 headings


In the future, I plan to add support for the following elements:
- [ ] Tables
- [ ] Quotes
- [ ] Keywords
- [ ] Footnotes
- [ ] Images
